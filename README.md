# Autowipes
I Am Not A Coder/Developer In Any Way, I Simply Made This Script To Do Auto Wipes On My Server Since I Never Found Anything Like it.
This Is Only The Announcements And The Command Executions

Automatic Carwipes Every 45 Minutes, And Entitywipes Every 1 Hour 

You can change how often they happen by changing "local a" on sv_ and "local x" on cl_

In the "No Gear Icon" folder you will find the code to remove the gear icon that shows up in the chat. 

To install it's the same as any other resource:
Drag and drop into your resources and add "start wipes" into your "server.cfg"
